# POEM: Love Season

See the [visualization](https://nicola.github.io/love-season-poem)

## What is this?
This is a simulation of 300 bodies. They all look for their other half every 6 seconds. Not everyone manages to see the other one in this amount of time. This is the simulation of love and society. You should stare at it as much as possible. 

There is one body which is free from any fixed rule of the universe in the simulation, that's me. I saved myself in a way.

You may want to move me, if this makes sense.
